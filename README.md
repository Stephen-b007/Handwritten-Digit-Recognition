# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project aims to develop a highly accurate machine learning model for classifying handwritten digits (0-9) with strong precision and recall, designed to generalize well to new data and avoid overfitting. Suitable for deployment in real-world OCR systems, this model facilitates precise and reliable digit recognition.
